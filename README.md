# Data Structure and Algorithm

This git repository contains detailed explanation and their corresponding implementation(in Java) of different useful DataStructures and Algorithms.

# Content Structure

All projects are in java directory.

# Part 1

### algo-analysis

How to assess the performance (Time Analysis and Space Analysis) of a given Data Structure and corresponding algorithms.

### union-find

Need to see if components in a system are connected or not? Union-find is a data structure using which we can add a component to a system which is called union(u, v) and also we can see whether two components in a given system are connected or not. Which we called find(u, v).

### percolation

Using the union-find we can solve a grid problem which is very useful for practical scenarios. percolation is such a problem which we solved using union-find.

### stack

Stack data structure different implementations(Array Based and List based). Usage of Stack data structure.  

### queue

Queue data structure different implementations(Array Based and List based). Usage of Stack data structure.

### queues

### sort

Different sorting algorithms, their explanation and implementations can be seen here. 

# Part 2

### graph

Need to know about graph data structure and uses of this. Can be seen in this folder.
